# Buying

There are two functions that you can use in order for you to be able to facilitate the secondary purchase of an NFT, that is, the purchase of an NFT that has already been minted by another wallet.

### Secondary marketplaces

One of the features of the Open Format protocol is the ability to re-sell NFT's on what is known as the secondary marketplace.
The `buy` function is what we will look over in this guide to get you started.

:::tip info

Before calling the buy function the token owner must set the token as available for sale. This can be done by calling `setTokenSalePrice` and passing a new sale price [(in Wei)](/glossary#wei).

      <button onClick={() => buy(tokenId)}>
        Buy NFT
      </button>
    </>
  );
}

<!-- <!-- ## Buy with commission

The buy with commision function handles the secondary sale of an NFT with a commision set. The commision is then sent to the commissionReceiverAddress.

:::tip info

Before calling the buy with commision function a commision percentage must be set by the creator of the NFT.
This can be done by calling `setSecondaryCommissionPercent`.
