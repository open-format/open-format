# Buying

There are two functions that you can use in order for you to be able to facilitate the secondary purchase of an NFT, that is, the purchase of an NFT that has already been minted by another wallet.

### Secondary marketplaces

One of the features of the Open Format protocol is the ability to re-sell NFT's on what is known as the secondary marketplace.
The `buy` function is what we will look over in this guide to get you started.

:::tip info

Before calling the buy function the token owner must set the token as available for sale. This can be done by calling `setTokenSalePrice` and passing a new sale price [(in Wei)](/glossary#wei).
