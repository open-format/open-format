The Open Format JavaScript SDK provides a simple way to interact with Open Format.

Don't forget to checkout our [React SDK](./react) which simplifies using the SDK even further.

## Installation

You can install the SDK with NPM or Yarn.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @simpleweb/open-format ethers
```

## Initialising the SDK

You can initialise the SDK by creating a new instance of `OpenFormatSDK` and selecting one of the available [networks](/glossary#networks) that are supported. This will create a new instance in "read-only" mode, meaning you can read from the [subgraph](/glossary#subgraph) but any interactions that require you to sign a transaction (deploying a new instance of the contract, minting an NFT, etc...) will throw an error.

```tsx
import { OpenFormatSDK } from '@simpleweb/open-format';

const sdk = new OpenFormatSDK({
  network: 'mumbai',
});
```

If you wish to do more than just interact with the [subgraph](/glossary#subgraph), you will have to provide a [`signer`](/glossary#signer) when initialising the SDK.

The easiest way to do this is by passing your wallet's private key as the [`signer`](/glossary#signer). You'd typically do this only from a Node.js context as to not expose your private key to the world.

```tsx
import { OpenFormatSDK } from '@simpleweb/open-format';

const sdk = new OpenFormatSDK({
  network: 'mumbai',
  signer: '0x...',
});
```

:::danger private keys

**NEVER** pass a private key when initialising the SDK in the client, as this is something that you **DO NOT** want to expose to the world.

:::

Instead of passing a private key, you can also pass a [`signer`](/glossary#signer) instance when initialising the SDK. You'd generally get an instance of a [`signer`](/glossary#signer) by having the user connect their wallet but in this contrived example we are manually creating a [`signer`](/glossary#signer) with the `ethers` library.

```tsx
import { OpenFormatSDK } from '@simpleweb/open-format';
import { ethers } from "ethers";

const signer = new ethers.Wallet(
  '0x...',
  new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('https://matic-mumbai.chainstacklabs.com/')
);

const sdk = new OpenFormatSDK({
  network: 'mumbai',
  signer,
});
```

Note that the [`signer`](/glossary#signer) and the SDK must be configured to use the same network.



## Deploying an NFT

If you are just starting out, you'll typically want to deploy a version of the contract so you can start interacting with it. To do this, call the `deploy` method with the options you'd like.

```tsx
await sdk.deploy({
  maxSupply: 100,
  mintingPrice: 0.01,
  name: "TICKET",
  symbol: "FESTIVAL",
  url: "ipfs://bafkreifxgd3n6uzlhtenlwycphesqlmwf7dmqqzwho4iz6r6wuwtqtneza"
});
```
